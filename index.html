  <title>All about Me! - By Elijah Williams </title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1> Hi! Welcome to my web bowser! </h1>
  <h2>
    __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
  </h2>
  <p> Basically, For whoever is reading this. i plan on making this my web for current stuff. Like maybe a calender
    somewhere or a reminder to do something.
  <p> But plans have changed. My brother told me to make my own website all about the GOAT (me) </p>
  <p> So, lets get started.</p>
  <h2>______________________________________________________________________________ </h2>
  <h2> Who i am! </h2>
  <p> My name is Elijah Taesean Williams and im 14 years old. Im in the 8th grade and im currently living with my
    brother. Some basic facts is that i like: my siblings, games,
    getting good grades, hanging out with friends. and as of recently basketball. </p>
  <p1> My extreme dislikes is: violent animals, Family drama, most of my family, loud noises, petty people, drinking.
  </p1>
  <h2> Where i am in life as of right now. </h2>
  <p1> Like i said, living with my brother and his girlfriend. Cam and Nat. really cool people and im doing amazing in
    school. I think im in a chill spot.
    I wanna get around to shaving my baby fat but maybe later. I have alot of friends and stuff and i mainly play on my
    computer for most of the day.
  </p1>
  <h2>

  <h2> Family tree </h2>
  <p> so we have my dad and my mom. Jocelyn Ruiz And Tommy Williams. Theyve been together around over 10 years (cant
    put a number on it) and have recently serperated.
    I dont wanna get into all the details so ima talk about my favorite siblings. Mya Twiggs and Camyrn Twiggs, AMAZING
    FUCKING PEOPLE BRO.
    They lived with me since all of my little tiny baby life and have been great supporters of mental health. Im 100%
    sure i wouldve turned out way differently if i didnt have my siblings.
    Mya, my cool older sister in a sense raised me basically. I would always hang out with her beacause she WAS the only
    one i could hang out with.
    She has her cons but shes a AMAZING cook and shes really nice and full of good vibes and good energy. dont mistake
    her for being weak tho,
    She can easily get mad and serious when needed. Shes my person to get my head out of the clouds, to set me straight
    if im ever doing anything wrong at all.
    Then we have the cool older brother known as Camryn or Cam, Hes a professional software enginner and is the tech
    guy. He works at bank of america and gets paid decently.
    That being said, you know how whenever you would have a computer problem and just cant figure it out? Yeah, Camryn
    is the guy to go to for the WHOLE family.
    You could also go to my dad but hes a little rusty and people dont like him that much. I wonder why? I mean my dad
    is a really nice person and hes funny to be around. Love my dad.
    I could talk about my mother but i dont wanna go through all of that drama. Me typing this out as we speak sorta
    makes my eyes flood with tears. </p>
 
  <h2> What i want to do when im older and do as a job. </h2>
  <p> I have taken a interest towards coding. Maybe its cause im around my older brother who codes for a living?
    I dont really know myself but the whole idea of coding seems so cool. When you code, you can code ANYTHING you ever
    want EVER.
    You want a model of sherk twerking to ju ju on that beat? you make that! you want to make a game about race cars and
    anime fighting at the same time? Do that!
    Hes been coaching me on the whole process, but holy SHIT is it hard. Its so complicated to do sometimes and gets so
    confusing. Luckly i dont have to worry bout that,
    Turns out alot of the professional software enginners STILL look up how to do current things to this DAY. So im in
    the greenish yellow for now. </p>

  <h2> My friends! </h2>

  <p> So i have alot of friends, ones from school and ones from online. Ill start with my school friends. </p>
  <p> One of my first friends is camryn. I met him in 6 grade and joined his friend group, hes a cool guy but hes
    anything but chill. He can crash out in two seconds flat. </p>
  <p> We play basketball and just talk about how school goes and how school is. </p>
  <p> My other friend is Malachi. Hes a tall skinny black dood (like camryn) but Malachi is kinda flinchy, so its fun to
    mess around with him and pretend try to punch him. </p>
  <p> He gets messed with so much tho. I feel bad for him alot but we chill and just do funny jokes. </p>
  <p> My other friend is carlos. He's a cocky dude tbh, hes funny but also a little cringe, but arent we all. I have a
    slight problem with him and thats his attitide.
    He thinks hes so smart all the time and always says, "This is easy that is easy" and its so annoying. But other than
    that hes funny and chill. </p>
  <p> Cortez, hes the smartass of the friend group. He has a good skill of pissing people off very easily. With can be
    benefitcal and annoying sometimes.
    He's big like me so naturally we get joked about by everyone (friendly and nonfriendly) but we dont mind that much.
  </p>
  <h3> My online friends. </h3>
  <p> First we have Chad. He lives in new york and hes just a chill black guy. Hes really funny and really the only
    "normal" and non freaky of the friend group.
    You know how sometimes you have taht one friend that brings a sense of comfort and normal? That's Chad basically so
    to speak. </p>
  <p> We have Rueben next. He lives in the uk and is one of the FUNNIEST people i ever seen ever. Hes actually so funny
    its not even funny.
    Hes nice to be around and hes really just a cool dude. He has his own mental health problems tho. He tried to kill
    himself on the regular and still does try to kill himself sometimes on a bad day. </p>
  <p> We end up talking him out of it and We swear its not a guilt trip or anything. Hes generally just kinda sad all
    the time so him hanging with us cheers him up atleast to some degree. </p>
  <p> Next we have joe, hes funny and should be in a mental asylum. He's crazy and does the most crazy stuff. Me and him
    match energy on the daily, Hes also matches me in being good in gameas.
    Hes generally a goofball and its so lovely to see someone match my energy sometimes.
  </p>
  <p> Next we have vesper. Shes our transfriend of the group transtating to boy to girl. Shes a nice person but shes the
    HOT head of the group. She cant keep her cool for shit and sometimes it gets her in unneeded drama.
    She's brainrotted (just like me fr) and shes cool and stuff. Like i said not being able to keep her cool makes her
    really annoying sometimes (no offense)
  </p>

  <h2> My phyiscal capabley </h2>
  <p> Im not the fittest guy on earth or anything but im a little below decent when it comes into the strength
    department. Its hard to carry medium weight items and i basically cant lift to do shit. the most i was able to do at
    a max was 60 k. </p>
  <h3> Speed and Agility. </h3>
  <p> Im actually pretty fast surprisingly. Im able to out run alot of my class mates (the fit and skinny ones) but the
    main problem is that i get winded VERY easy and it takes a hot minute to regain that stamina. By the time i wouldve
    regained the stamina,
    they would far ahead of me </p>
  <h3> My height. </h3>
  <p> Im actually going very tall for my age apparenetly. Im smaller then a tad bit of people in my class but for the
    most part im taller then most people in my class. Im taller then most of my relatives as well. </p>
  <h3> Hearing. </h3>
  <p> Honestly this is probably my worse phyiscal property for the simple fact i cant hear for shit. I keep my ears out
    every now and then but i still can barely hear ANYTHING. It normally takes a repeat of at most 3 times. </p>
  <h3> My eyesight. </h3>
  <p> Probably one of my stronger departments of the phyiscal properties. Im able to see from far away but i suck for
    looking for stuff. Sometimes something would be right infront of me and its like its fucking invisable but only for
    me. </p>
  <h3> Immune system. </h3>
  <p> My immune system is really good. If i ever get sick it only takes about a day or two to start feeling all great
    and good again. It fights off virus real good and does what any other immmune system would do but better, cuz im
    young. </p>
