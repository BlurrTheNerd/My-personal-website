      <h1> Hi! Welcome to my web browser! </h1>
      <p>
         Basically, For whoever is reading this. I plan on making this my web for current stuff. Like maybe a calendar
         somewhere or a reminder to do something.
      </p>
      <p> But plans have changed. My brother told me to make my own website all about the GOAT (me) </p>
      <p> So, let's get started.</p>
      <h2> Who I am! </h2>
      <p>
         My name is Elijah Taesean Williams and im 14 years old. Im in the 8th grade and im currently living with my
         brother. Some basic facts is that I like: my siblings, games,
         getting good grades, hanging out with friends, and as of recently basketball. 
      </p>
      <p>
         My extreme dislikes are: violent animals, Family drama, most of my family, loud noises, petty people, and
         drinking.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h2> Where I am in life as of right now. </h2>
      <p>
         Like I said, I am living with my brother and his girlfriend. Cam and Nat. Really cool people and I'm doing
         amazing in
         school. I think im in a chill spot.
         I wanna get around to shaving my baby fat but maybe later. I have a lot of friends and stuff and I mainly play on my
         computer for most of the day.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h2> Family Tree </h2>
      <p>
         So we have my dad and my mom. Joselyn Ruiz And Tommie Williams. They've been together around over 10 years (can't
         put a number on it) and have recently separated.
         I don't wanna get into all the details so ima talk about my favorite siblings. Mya Twiggs and Cameron Twiggs,
         AMAZING
         FUCKING PEOPLE BRO.
         They lived with me since all of my little tiny baby life and have been great supporters of mental health. I'm 100%
         sure I would've turned out way differently if I didn't have my siblings.
         Mya, my cool older sister in a sense raised me basically. I would always hang out with her because she WAS the only
         one I could hang out with.
         She has her cons but she's an AMAZING cook and she's really nice and full of good vibes and good energy. Don't
         mistake her for being weak tho.
         She can easily get mad and serious when needed. She's my person to get my head out of the clouds, to set me
         straight, if im ever doing anything wrong at all.
         Then we have the cool older brother known as Cameron or Cam, He's a professional software engineer and is the tech
         guy. He works at Bank of America.
         That being said, you know how whenever you would have a computer problem and just can't figure it out? Yeah, Cameron
         is the guy to go to for the WHOLE family.
         You could also go to my dad but he's a little rusty and people don't like him that much. I wonder why? I mean my dad
         is a really nice person and he's funny to be around. Love my dad.
         I could talk about my mother but I don't wanna go through all of that drama. Me typing this out as we speak sorta
         makes my eyes flood with tears.
      </p>
      <h2> What I want to do when im older and do as a job. </h2>
      <p>
         I have taken an interest towards coding. Maybe it's cause I'm around my older brother who codes for a living?
         I don't really know myself but the whole idea of coding seems so cool. When you code, you can code ANYTHING you ever
         want EVER.
         You want a model of sherk twerking to JuJu on that beat? you make that! You want to make a game about race cars and
         anime fighting at the same time? Do that!
         He's been coaching me on the whole process, but holy SHIT is it hard. It's so complicated to do sometimes and gets
         so confusing. Luckily I don't have to worry 'bout that.
         Turns out a lot of the professional software engineers STILL look up how to do current things to this DAY. So I'm in
         the greenish-yellow for now. 
      </p>

      <h2> My friends! </h2>
      <p> So I have a lot of friends, ones from school and ones from online. I'll start with my school friends. </p>
      <p>
        One of my first friends is Camryn. I met him in 6 grade and joined his friend group, he's a cool guy but he's
        anything but chill. He can crash out in two seconds flat. 
      </p>
      <p> We play basketball and just talk about how school goes and how school is. </p>
      <p> 
         My other friend is Malachi. He's a tall skinny black dood (like Cameron) but Malachi is kinda flinchy, so it's fun to
         mess around with him and pretend to try to punch him. 
      </p>
      <p> He gets messed with so much tho. I feel bad for him a lot but we chill and just do funny jokes. </p>
      <p>
         My other friend is Carlos. He's a cocky dude tbh, he's funny but also a little cringe, but aren't we all. I have a
         slight problem with him and that's his attitude.
         He thinks he's so smart all the time and always says, "This is easy that is easy" and it's so annoying. But other
         than that he's funny and chill. 
      </p>
      <p> 
         Cortez, is the smartass of the friend group. He's skilled at pissing people off very easily. Which can be
         beneficial and annoying sometimes.
         He's big like me so naturally we get joked about by everyone (friendly and nonfriendly) but we don't mind that much.
      </p>
      <h3> My online friends. </h3>
      <p> 
         First we have Chad. He lives in New York and he's just a chill black guy. He's really funny and really the only
         "normal" and non-freaky of the friend group. You know how sometimes you have taht one friend that brings a sense of
         comfort and normal? That's Chad basically so to speak. 
      </p>
      <p> 
         We have Rueben next. He lives in the UK and is one of the FUNNIEST people I've ever met. He's actually so funny
         it's not even funny. He's nice to be around and he's really just a cool dude. He has his own mental health problems
         tho, but him hanging with us cheers him up at least to some degree 
      </p>
      <p> 
         Next we have Joe, he's funny and should be in a mental asylum. He's crazy and does the most crazy stuff. Me and
         him
         match energy on the daily. He also matches me in being good at games.
         He is generally a goofball and its so lovely to see someone match my energy sometimes.
      </p>
      <p> 
         Next we have Vesper. She's our trans-friend of the group transitioning from boy to girl. She's a nice person but
         she's the
         HOT head of the group. She can't keep her cool for shit and sometimes it gets her in un-needed drama. She's brain
         rotted (just like me fr) and she's cool and stuff. Like I said not being able to keep her cool makes her really
         annoying sometimes (no offense)
      </p>

      <h2> My Physical Capability </h2>
      <p> 
         I'm not the fittest guy on earth or anything but I'm a little below decent when it comes to the strength
         department. It's hard to carry medium-weight items and I can't lift to for shit. The most I was able to do at a max
         was 60 kg. 
      </p>
      <h3> Speed and Agility. </h3>
      <p> 
         I'm actually pretty fast surprisingly. I'm able to outrun many of my classmates (the fit and skinny ones) but the
         main problem is that I get winded VERY easily and it takes a hot minute to regain that stamina. By the time I
         would've
         regained the stamina, they would be far ahead of me. 
      </p>
      <h3> My height. </h3>
      <p> 
         I'm actually very tall for my age apparently. I'm taller most people in my class. I'm taller than most of my
         relatives as well. 
      </p>
      <h3> Hearing. </h3>
      <p> Honestly this is probably my worst physical property for the simple fact I can't hear for shit. I keep my ears out
         every now and then but I still can barely hear ANYTHING. It normally takes a repeat of at most 3 times. 
      </p>
      <h3> My eyesight. </h3>
      <p> Probably one of my stronger departments of the physical capability. I'm able to see from far away but I suck at
         looking for stuff. Sometimes something would be right in front of me and it's like it's fucking invisible but only
         for me. 
      </p>
      <h3> Immune system. </h3>
      <p> My immune system is really good. If I ever get sick it only takes about a day or two to start feeling all great
         and good again. It fights off virus real good and does what any other immune system would do but better, cuz I'm
         young. 
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h2> My intellectual knowledge. </h2>
      <p> I'm a very smart person. Throughout most of my school years I've been the guy to have all a's and b's. I'm getting
         pretty good at web development and coding as well. 
      </p>
      <p> I have a good sense of self and justice. I don't try to do bad and always try my best to do the right thing. It
         gets really hard tho. 
      </p>
      <h2> Life lessons i learned. </h2>
      <p>  
      <h3> "DONT DRINK!" </h3>
      I learned this one sorta early on. Mom drinks alot and it sucks. From what ive seen drinking fucks you all the way up and sucks for everyone involved.
      You become rash, you have constant mood swings, you become angry, you do things you wouldn't do normally.
      Growing up i had to know if mom was drunk or not to speak to her.
      Growing up i had to get used to the smell of wine and all that other stuff to the point that i had to build a immunity to it.
      Growing up i struggled to come to terms that my mom was a alcoholic.
      I hated whenever mom was drunk (which was always late at night) and lowkey sucked cheeks. It was always loud at night and i could barely ever get sleep.
      Whenever i had to chores mom would always yell at me and if i didnt do something within a couple of seconds she would get pissed and take away the game.
      Most of this happened when drunk and few very rare when she was sober.
      It was so bad to the point that she even kicked me, my dad, and my brother out the house when i was young. And that wasnt even the worst part.
      Its safe to say that she scared my older sister into not drinking. Which is very vaild.
      Im not saying im not going to atleast try it once when i am older. But i wont ever be the "drinking" type and i wont ever be the one to drink more then 2 shots.
   </p>
         <p> 
          <h3> "Go The Distance." </h3>
          You know when you have that one really annoying thing to do but if you do it you get awarded big time?
          Always chase that. Always go the extra mile to do stuff. 
          There was this one time. In the 3rd grade, I had this up coming test on math. And of course, math was my worse subject.
          I was so scared. I was not doing the best at the time and I didnt wanna fail 3rd grade like how i did 1st grade.
          When i went to school, it wasnt any better. Everyone was stressed and so angry. When i told them about my doubts and struggles they all basically doubted my ability to do good.
         Hell, even my teachers doubted me. They thought i was a utter disapointment. I couldnt focus in class ever and i would not be a high grades student. Sure i was good in behavior but what was all of that to someone who gets A's and B's?
         I was sad, but that quickly turned into anger. I was done with people being mean and doubting me. Sure it was 3rd grade and they didnt have proper emotion control. (Atleast the kids) But i didnt know that?
         I took that test, I dreaded the result. And boom, I got one of the HIGHEST scores ever. Everyone was like WHAT and i remember being so happy.
         From then on, I would try my best at everything i cared about. School, family, everything.
         I want you to invision something right now. if thats your dreams, your wants, your happy place, Chase that. 
         I believe that if your not willing to put in the effort to achieve something, Then it wasnt met to be, other then some miss opportunity.
         Always. Travel. The. Distance.
